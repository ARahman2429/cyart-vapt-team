# Exploitation Lab

## Objective
To validate whether identified vulnerabilities could be exploited under real-world conditions using controlled and ethical methods.

## Tools Used
- Metasploit Framework
- Kali Linux

## Target
- Metasploitable2 (192.168.1.100)

## Exploitation Attempts

### VSFTPD Backdoor Exploit
- Module Used: exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
- Result: Connection timed out
- Reason: FTP service port was filtered and not reachable

### Apache Tomcat Manager Exploit
- Module Used: exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy
- Credentials Used: tomcat / tomcat
- Payload: java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
- Result: Exploit executed but connection timed out
- Reason: Network-level restrictions prevented successful session establishment

## Outcome
Exploitation attempts were unsuccessful due to restricted service exposure and network controls.

## Notes
Failed exploitation attempts were documented and analyzed as part of the assessment, reflecting real-world penetration testing scenarios where defensive controls limit exploitability.
