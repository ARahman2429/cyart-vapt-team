# Vulnerability Scanning Lab

## Objective
To identify exposed services and vulnerabilities on the target system using industry-standard scanning tools.

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager)

## Target
- Metasploitable2 (192.168.1.100)

## Steps Performed
1. Conducted service enumeration using Nmap with service version detection.
2. Identified open and filtered ports to understand the attack surface.
3. Performed automated vulnerability scanning using OpenVAS with a Full and Fast scan configuration.
4. Reviewed vulnerabilities and categorized them based on severity using CVSS scoring.

## Outcome
Multiple vulnerabilities of varying severity were identified. Network-level filtering limited service exposure, reducing exploitability.

## Notes
This lab focused on vulnerability identification and risk assessment rather than exploitation.
