## Step 1: Planning and Scope Definition
- Defined assessment objectives and scope
- Selected Metasploitable2 as the target system
- Configured an isolated host-only lab environment

## Step 2: Reconnaissance and Discovery
- Verified host availability
- Performed port scanning to identify open services
- Conducted service and version enumeration

## Step 3: Vulnerability Assessment
- Used automated vulnerability scanning tools
- Identified outdated services and known vulnerabilities
- Mapped vulnerabilities to CVEs and CVSS scores

## Step 4: Risk Assessment and Prioritization
- Evaluated likelihood and impact of identified vulnerabilities
- Categorized risks as Low, Medium, High, or Critical
- Prioritized findings for remediation

## Step 5: Documentation and Reporting
- Documented technical findings with evidence
- Prepared risk analysis and remediation recommendations
- Created professional VAPT report for technical and non-technical audiences
