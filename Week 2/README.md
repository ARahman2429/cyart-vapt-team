# Week 2 – Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)

This repository contains the complete Week 2 VAPT deliverables as part of the CyArt cybersecurity training program.

---

## Scope of Work
- Internal Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing
- Target: Metasploitable2 (Internal Lab Environment)
- Approach: Unauthenticated Black-Box Testing

---

## Contents

### Documentation
- Industry-standard VAPT Report (PDF)
- Theoretical notes covering vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and exploit development
- CVSS-based risk assessment explanations

### Screenshots
- Nmap service enumeration
- OpenVAS dashboard, target configuration, scan execution, and results
- Metasploit exploitation attempts and timeout validation

### Practical Labs
- Vulnerability scanning using Nmap and OpenVAS
- Reconnaissance and enumeration methodology
- Exploitation attempts using Metasploit
- Post-exploitation considerations

### Workflow
- Step-by-step VAPT workflow aligned with PTES and NIST SP 800-115
- Reconnaissance → Scanning → Analysis → Exploitation → Validation → Reporting

---

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Nmap
- OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager)
- Metasploit Framework

---

## Notes
Exploitation attempts were performed strictly within scope and ethical boundaries. 
Certain exploits resulted in connection timeouts due to network-level restrictions, which were documented and analyzed as part of the assessment.

## Status
✔ Week 2 VAPT tasks completed and submitted
